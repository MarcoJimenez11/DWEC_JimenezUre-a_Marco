//4. Hereâ€™s a code that asks the user for two numbers and shows their sum. It works incorrectly.
//  The output in the example below is 12 (for default prompt values). Why? Fix it. The result
//  should be 3.

a = prompt("First number?", 1);
b = prompt("Second number?", 2);
alert(a + b); // 12

//The code below fails because it's treating the inputs like strings so it's concatenating them.
//Instead, one way of doing it is parsing the strings into integers and then making the operation.

a = parseInt(prompt("First number?", 1));
b = parseInt(prompt("Second number?", 2));
alert(a + b); // 3
